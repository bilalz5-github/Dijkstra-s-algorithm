## Contents of the Zip Folder

Hello,

This zip folder includes three essential files for the project:

1. **bigtable.txt:** Contains the binary data matrix that the Python code processes.

2. **Problemthree.py:** A Python script designed to read the binary matrix from `bigtable.txt`, analyze it to identify the most profitable path, and mark this path with asterisks.

3. **textFilepython.txt:** A script for running the Python code in `Problemthree.py`.

## Instructions

To execute the code and view the results, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.

2. Extract the contents of the zip folder to a directory of your choice.

3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder containing the extracted files.

4. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python textFilepython.txt
    ```

5. The code will read the binary matrix from `bigtable.txt`, identify the most profitable path, mark it with asterisks, and display the marked matrix along with the profit value.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.
```

This version removes the "[Your Name]" and maintains the rest of the content in the README file.
